As of June 30th 2017:

Covar_ui is close to done.

- 
- 
- No tests were made on the interface for 3D grids.

Data management through SQLAlchemy has been fully implemented in database_ui and covar_ui, and the main submodules.
Some other modules still lack this implementation, though. One should consider close to every *.bh, *.mog, *.model and
*.air attributes deprecated if applied to a user interface. Those should be replaced by a call into the database by
the means of <module>.session.query(<Class>).

Be wary of the tools such as auto_create_scrollbar() and lay() in utils_ui, as they provide a way of reducing the
quantity of code for a specified task and improving readability. (Full list of ignored errors: E202, E221, E241, E501, E722, E741)

Arguments unpacking is used thoroughly in covar_ui and utils_ui, so one should become comfortable with this functionality
of Python. The star ('*') is used to separate an iterable into different arguments. Therefore, 'print(*['a', 'b', 'c'])' reads
for the program as 'print('a', 'b', 'c')'.

The code is fully PEP 8 compatible, exception made for the extra spaces before and after operators and for lines too long,
which are ignored for the purpose of readability.

Finally, one should refer to the TODO annotations for specific tasks. Those may require a better understanding of BhTomoPy, though.
